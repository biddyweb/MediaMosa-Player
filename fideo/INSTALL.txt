In order to install the Drupal module, and start using the HTML5 player with
Flash fallback player, follow the next steps carefully. If you just want to
see an example, check out example.html in the 'example' directory.

1. Place the entire module folder inside a Drupal 6 installation. Usually the
   Drupal module should be placed in:
   sites/all/modules/fideo

2. Fideo uses Flowplayer as fallback player in case the visitor's browser
   doesn't support HTML5 video. Because Flowplayer is licensed under GPLv3 it
   cannot be shipped with Flowplayer. You should download the following files:

   FlowPlayer 3.2.5 (it's tested with 3.2.5 but you can try newer if you like)
   http://releases.flowplayer.org/flowplayer/flowplayer-3.2.5.zip

   For captions support you'll need:
   http://releases.flowplayer.org/flowplayer.captions/flowplayer.captions-3.2.2.swf
   http://releases.flowplayer.org/flowplayer.content/flowplayer.content-3.2.0.swf
   http://releases.flowplayer.org/flowplayer.controls/flowplayer.controls-3.2.3.swf

3. Unpack the FlowPlayer zip you've downloaded into the /assets/flowplayer/
   directory inside the fideo module directory. The main FlowPlayer swf should
   be accessible through: fideo/assets/flowplayer/flowplayer-3.2.5.swf.

4. Install the Drupal module "Fideo" by going to admin/build/modules.

5. Check out the demo page by going to the path 'fideo'.

6. In the fideo.module is a function called fideo_format() which presents the
   data structure for video files. You can change the file URL's to point to
   your own video's.
