In order to install the Drupal module, and start using the HTML5 player with
Flash fallback player, follow the next steps carefully. If you just want to
see an example, check out example.html in the 'example' directory.

1. Place the entire module folder inside a Drupal 7 installation. Usually the
   Drupal module should be placed in:
   sites/all/modules/fideo

2. Install the Drupal module "Fideo" by going to admin/build/modules.

3. Check out the demo page by going to the path 'fideo' in your Drupal install.

4. In the fideo.demo.inc is a function called fideo_format() which presents the
   data structure for video files. Take that format and use it in your own
   Drupal module to make the structure you need, with files pointing to your
   video files and call fideo_render().
