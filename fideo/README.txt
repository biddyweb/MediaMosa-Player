The Fideo module is a Drupal module (currently for Drupal 6 only) that
demonstrates the working of the HTML5 based multisource player.

The HTML5 player-part of Fideo is based on VideoJS (www.videojs.com).

The Fideo project is started as an initiative for an open source videoplayer
for the open source project MediaMosa. It's licensed under LGPLv3 because it's
base components come from the VideoJs project which is released under LGPLv3
as well.
